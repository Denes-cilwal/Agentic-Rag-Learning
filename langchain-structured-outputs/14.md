The issue is a compatibility mismatch between the method you are using to extract data and the specific model being called.

The Problem

When you call model.with_structured_output(json_schema), LangChain defaults to using a method called json_schema (OpenAI's "Structured Outputs" feature). This feature requires specific, newer models like gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini.

By default, the ChatOpenAI() class often points to gpt-3.5-turbo. Because gpt-3.5-turbo is an older model, it does not support the strict json_schema enforcement

The Result
The Warning: LangChain detects that the model can't handle the requested method, so it automatically "downgrades" the technique to function_calling to prevent the code from crashing.

The Output: It still works! You received the dictionary correctly, but the warning is there to let you know that the "strict" schema enforcement isn't active.

How to Fix It
You have two main ways to resolve this:

Option 1: Upgrade the Model (Recommended)
Switch to a model that natively supports the json_schema method. This provides higher accuracy for extraction.

# Change this line:

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

Option 2: Explicitly set the Method
If you must use gpt-3.5-turbo, tell LangChain to use function_calling from the start to suppress the warning.

# Change this line:

structured_model = model.with_structured_output(json_schema, method="function_calling")

WHy structured output is needed ?

1. Reliable API Interactions
   If you are building an app that sends data to another service (like a shipping API or a CRM like Salesforce), that service will reject the request if it’s even slightly off.

Unstructured: "The user is Dinesh and he liked the phone." (API says: Error 400 - Invalid Format)

Structured: {"user": "Dinesh", "sentiment": "pos"} (API says: 200 OK)

2. Database Integration
   If you want to save thousands of reviews into a table to create a "Dashboard," you need columns. Structured output allows the LLM to act as a data entry clerk, perfectly placing the "Pro" into the pros column and the "Price" into the price column.
